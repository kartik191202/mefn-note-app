## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK installed  
- Node.js installed  
- [Database, e.g. MongoDB] installed / accessible  
- (Optional) `.env` file with environment variables  

### Running Locally

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mefn-note-app.git
   cd mefn-note-app
Backend setup:

bash
Copy code
cd backend
npm install
# or yarn install
# Create a .env file inside backend with required variables, e.g.:
#   PORT=5000
#   DB_URI=your_database_uri
#   JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
npm start
The backend should now be running (e.g. at http://localhost:5000).

Frontend setup:

bash
Copy code
cd ../frontend
flutter pub get
flutter run
You can run on emulator, simulator or real device.

Connect frontend to backend:

In your Flutter code, ensure base API URLs point to your backend (like http://localhost:5000/api/...)

If running backend and frontend on different hosts/ports, configure CORS in backend.

📦 Build & Deployment
Backend:

Use npm run build (if you have a build step) or simply run on a server

Deploy to Heroku, AWS EC2, or any Node.js hosting

Frontend:

Use flutter build apk / flutter build ios / flutter build web depending on target

Host the web build in Netlify / Vercel or include it in your mobile builds

Environment Variables:

Keep secret data (DB URI, API keys) in .env; do not commit .env file

Add .env to .gitignore

✅ Features / TODOs
 Create, Read, Update, Delete notes (CRUD)

 Authentication (signup / login)

 Sync notes across devices

 Search / Filter

 Offline access / caching

 Dark mode / UI polish

 Notifications / Reminders

 User settings / profile

You can check the Issues tab in this repository for current pending tasks.

🛠 Development Tips & Notes
Use proper error handling in backend (try/catch, express error middleware)

Secure endpoints (verify JWT, validate input)

In Flutter, use state management (Provider / BLoC / Riverpod)

Optimize network calls (debouncing, caching)

Keep UI responsive (avoid blocking the main thread)
