# TODO: Fix Sign Up Button Error

## Steps:
1. [x] Edit lib/ui/sign_up_page.dart to add missing type parameters to BlocConsumer.
2. [x] Ran flutter analyze - no compilation errors related to the fix.
3. [x] Ran flutter run - app builds and runs successfully; the runtime error on sign up tap is a network connection timeout to the backend server (http://10.0.2.2:8000), not a code issue.
4. [x] Update this TODO.md to mark completion.
